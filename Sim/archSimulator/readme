To start using the prgram follow these steps:

--------------------------------------------------
To supply own design file, program file, etc

(a) In this folder execute the command ' g++ prog1.cpp -o archSim'
(b) Execute the following command ' ./archSim'


--------------------------------------------------
To use an embedded design file that implements the instruction
set covered in the class:

(a) In this folder execute the command 'g++ prog2.cpp -o stdArchSim'
(b) Execute the following command ' ./stdArchSim'


Note: Only the executables are to be installed on the mirage
      server for students' use. They should test the tutorial
      and other lab problems using "stdArchSim". They can try
      executing these and other problems using "archSim" with
      own microprogram design for each opcode.
